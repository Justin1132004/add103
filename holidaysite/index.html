<h1>Merry Christmas!</h1>
<p>The most wonderful time of year is nearly here! Christmas, just 43 weeks away! Now is the perfect time to start playing Mariah Carrey in retail stores and fill the halls with holiday cheer!</p>

<h2>You're invited to the annual festival!</h2>
<p>Come to the annual Christmas Celebration on 0000 Nullplace Blvd on December 17th for a day of fun and festivities! </p>

<h3>Some Information:</h3>
<p>The event is free to attend for all ages and will run from 3 to 9 PM CST.</p>
<p>There will be free food and drinks, but visitors are welcome to bring their own dishes as well. We ask that no alcoholic beverages are brought to the table.</p>
<p>Various events will be available for the children such as face painting, cookie decorating, and creating reindeer chow!</p>
<p>For adults there will be a raffle and white elephant. Please bring a gift for the grab bag.</p>
<p>We will end the night by destroying all calendars that show holidays that are not Christmas. Only Christmas will be tolerated and celebrated. Resistance is futile and having no Christmas spirit will be punished.</p> 
<!-- Needed to pad this out. I'm not proud of this but I spent too long on it. -->

<h4>Don't miss it!</h4>
<p>This year's celebration is to commemorate 65 years of holiday cheer. Since 1960, our Christmas celebration has been the largest and only event within the empty void. Come join part of the fun as we celebrate our non-existent history and holiday tradition!</p>
<p>We're so excited to have you, that we're sending this invitation out 10 months in advance! No celebration of any other holiday will be permitted, only Christmas. So if you were looking forward to anything else, you are out of luck.</p>
