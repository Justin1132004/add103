<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p>LittleBigPlanet stars <em>Sackboy</em>, a sentient doll that the user must guide through official and user made platforming levels. There is a lives system in the form of checkpoints that the player must reach, the number of lives depends on how many were specified for that checkpoint by the creator of the level. There are various dangers that players can add to their levels for Sackboy to evade such as electricity, bombs, enemies, and projectiles. Sackboy can also obtain power-ups such as a paint gun that can activate switches and defeat enemies.</p>

<h3>Character Customization</h3>

<p>What is unique about the character Sackboy is that they do not have much personality of their own apart from preset expressions that the player can take on by pressing the directional arrows on the d-pad. Up makes Sackboy happy, down makes them sad. Left makes them scared and right makes them angry.
    Sackboy's appearance can also be customized to the player's liking with a huge assortment of custom accessories and stickers that the player can put on them. Accessories such as stickers and even character outfits can be provided to the player from other players through prize bubbles located in levels. The motto of the game is <q><i>Play, Create, Share</i></q> and user generated content is the backbone of levels and player customization. </p>
