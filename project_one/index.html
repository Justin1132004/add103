          Hello, I am Justin Morvay. I am a 21-year-old audio visual technician currently enrolled in McHenry County College. I am
          taking web development classes in pursuit of an associate's degree in computer science and a career in IT development. I
          want to work in IT because of my fatherâ€™s success in the field, I have been modifying code for fun since I was 12 years
          old and now I am making the effort to turn a childhood hobby into a career.
