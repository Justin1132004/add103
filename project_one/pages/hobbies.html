            I have a few hobbies, such as playing games, reading, and collecting souvenir coffee mugs from the places I visit. My
            hobby of playing video games has had an impact on my decision to go into programming. When I was twelve years old, I
            spent a lot of time on a game called Garry’s Mod, which is a game that allows you to create scripts using an embedded language
            named GLua. I got my start with programming when I decompiled other people’s mods and edited the code for personal use.
            I went back and forth using the official wiki and made my own stuff out of other people’s code, it wasn’t good code, but
            I was having fun spending hours making my ideas become a reality. I continued to do this through the years, finding ways
            to modify the games that I play and at one point tried to create a mod for a game called half-life, which I found out
            how to modify the SDK of and played around with modifying C++ code. So, while video gaming may be a distraction, it has
            had an effect on how I see my future especially as coding and cyber security has become a very prospective industry.

            Another hobby I have is collecting coffee mugs. I like to travel with my family, we go on a few road trips a year. For
            trips that I want to remember, such as when we went to Disney World, I buy a decorative mug to commemorate it and put it
            on my desk. I have a lot of coffee mugs; many are gifts and gag gifts given to me by my second oldest brother, which is
            a fun tradition we do every year during the holidays.
