          I currently have a job working at a Lutheran Church named Shephard Of The Hills (SOTH). I am an Audio-Visual technician
          which means that I work in a booth where I am in control of the audio, presentation, and cameras during a session. On
          Saturdays and Sundays I go into the Church and turn on the computers and set up the program for that day. On Saturdays
          all I have to do is start the program and control the audio and presentation. On Sundays, however, I am in charge of
          starting the Facebook and YouTube live streams in OBS and controlling the cameras. Most of the time, there is another AV
          tech with me during Sundays but there are also other times in which I had to manage alone. Overall, it is not a bad
          first job and everyone is very friendly there. I hope to build up my resume so that I can find a more sustainable job after college.

        <p>This is the type of equipment that I work with, I turn it on first thing during the day. While it has physical switches and buttons, once it is on I control those switches from a distance using an app from a tablet at the AV booth. </p>
